=== Git Rail Diff ===

This plugin highlights lines you have added since your last git commit.  This
has been the result of some quick hacking, and so probably has a long way to go
before I'd consider it useful for all.

If you feel like contributing, please feel free to ping me as I'd be happy to
have your help.


== Installation ==

To add it as a plugin to Sublime, checkout the folder GitHighlightDiff to your
Packages/ dir, wherever that may be for your particular system.  (I work on OSX,
where it's at ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/).  'git',
the binary, will need to be in your path.
